# 📦 Supply Chain Service Level Analytics

This project tackles a real-world supply chain problem faced by **AtliQ Mart**, an FMCG manufacturer. It focuses on analyzing order fulfillment service levels to help improve customer satisfaction and reduce contract loss due to delivery issues.

## 🚀 Challenge

**🎯 Problem Statement:**  
AtliQ Mart, based in Gujarat, India, operates in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. Due to service-level issues, some key customers have not renewed their contracts. Management suspects delayed or incomplete deliveries of essential products.

Before expanding to metro/Tier-1 cities, they want to:
- Track **On-time (OT%)**, **In-Full (IF%)**, and **On-Time In-Full (OTIF%)** service levels
- Identify low-performing customers, cities, and products
- React quickly to bottlenecks in delivery
